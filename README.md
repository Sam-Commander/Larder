PSQL connected Command Line app.

Larder allows users to store details of their favourite recipes in a PSQL database.
These recipes can then be queried into a weekly meal plan that handles duplicated ingredients and creates an alphabetised shopping list.
Version is 2.1, will be gradually updated to better handle user errors and allow further meal plan options.

Commit 1 - V2.0 - Initial app.\
Commit 2 - V2.1 - Recipe deletion option added.

Make sure PSQL and Java are installed on your machine, then run the .sql file found in folder DBSetup to create the database.
Lastly run the code via Terminal, Command Line or an IDE etc.
